# Start of Pseudocode

# Purpose: Simulate how an MPU-6050 sensor interacts with a servo motor and an LED.

# Step 1: Simulate Sensor Data
# This function simulates the data you would get from an MPU-6050 sensor.
# It will generate random values to represent gyroscope and accelerometer data.
# Gyroscope measures rotation in degrees per second around the x, y, and z axes.
# Accelerometer measures acceleration in meters per second squared along the x, y, and z axes.
# - Generate random gyroscope data for yaw (rotation around x-axis), pitch (rotation around y-axis), and roll (rotation around z-axis).
# - Generate random accelerometer data for x, y, and z acceleration.
# - Return these values to be used by other parts of the simulation.

# Step 2: Simulate Servo Motor Behavior
# This function simulates how a servo motor would react based on the gyroscope data.
# A servo motor can move to a specific angle based on the input it receives.
# For simplicity, let's assume we are only using the yaw value from the gyroscope to determine the servo's position.
# - Input: Gyroscope data (specifically the yaw value).
# - Based on the yaw value, calculate a new position for the servo motor. 
#   For example, you might map the yaw value directly to the servo's position or use some formula to determine it.
# - Return the calculated position of the servo motor.

# Step 3: Simulate LED Brightness
# This function simulates changing the brightness of an LED based on accelerometer data.
# For simplicity, let's use the z-axis acceleration to determine the LED's brightness.
# - Input: Accelerometer data (specifically the z-axis value).
# - Based on the z-axis acceleration, calculate the brightness level of the LED.
#   For example, higher acceleration could correspond to higher brightness.
# - Return the calculated brightness level of the LED.

# Main Program Flow
# The main flow of the program where we tie all the simulations together.
# - First, call the function to simulate sensor data and store the returned values.
# - Extract the gyroscope and accelerometer data from the returned values.
# - Call the servo motor simulation function with the gyroscope data (yaw value) to get the servo's position.
# - Call the LED simulation function with the accelerometer data (z-axis value) to get the LED's brightness level.
# - Print the simulated sensor data, servo motor position, and LED brightness to observe the results of our simulation.
